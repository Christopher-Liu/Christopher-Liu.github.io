          <p class="section-title">About Me</p>
          <p> My name is Christopher Liu, a statistician and data scientist pursuing an MS in Statistics at San Diego State University. My research has been on the application of machine learning techniques to neuroimaging in order to assess the predictive ability of brain images on predicting Autism Spectrum Disorders. </p>

          <p> Throughout my projects, I have developed proficiency with a number of standard data science tools and software such as R, Python (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn), and SQL. </p>

          <p> Below you can find some of the projects I have worked on: </p>

              <span class="description-text">
                An end-to-end analysis and of bicycle rental data from <a href='https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data'>Capital Bikeshare</a>, a bicycle sharing company operating in the Washington DC metro area, that goes all the way back to 2013. Since the full data set was larger than the available amount of memory, data aggregation and transformation with regular in-memory tools was not possible, so PostgreSQL was utilized for loading and aggregating the data in chunks. Exponential smoothing and ARIMA time series methods were then applied to produce accurate models that fit the data to within 8% error and provided robust forecasts of expected bicycle rentals in the coming year. All of the data exploration and analysis was done with Python and its associated data analysis libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib), and the time series modeling was done with the <a href='https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html'>statsmodels</a> library.

              <span class="description-text">
                Interactive tutorial for learning the theory behind PCA (Principal Components Analysis) and how to apply it in R. PCA is a popular technique used in data science/machine learning as well as research domains, such as neuroimaging (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724763/'>Li et al., 2008</a>, <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.20074'>Viviani et al., 2004</a>), for reducing the dimensionality of data without significant loss of information. PCA is particularly useful in "n << p" problems, where the amount of variables far outnumbers the sample size. The tutorial was made with R Markdown and R Shiny.
